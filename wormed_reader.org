Wormed Voice is a two day practical workshop exploring the physical,
electronic and software simulated creation of non-human voices and
vocalisations. The history of speech synthesis stresses the mundane,
the military and the spectacular, commencing with Van Kempelenâ€™s 18th
century rubber squeaking or speaking machine. The basic principle of
simulating the vocal tract through electronic and physical means was
submitted to the military demands of compression and encryption,
segmenting out parts of the speech process and reducing redundancy.

In the process communication becomes the business of circuit-bent
human-worms, opening human and animal speech to the cut-up, to
stammerings, stutterings and tics; to an extra-human, outer-word
terrain of numbers burrowed and nibbled by the earthworms.

The workshop will feast on this electronic legacy. Participants will
learn the basic principles of voice synthesis and produce a
custom-designed touch-speech synthesizer which they can expand at
will.

This workshop is led by Martin Howse. Martin Howse is occupied with an
investigation of the links between the earth (geophysical phenomena),
software and the human psyche (psychogeophysics) through the
construction of experimental situations (performance, laboratories,
walks, and workshops), material art works and texts. He is equally the
creator of the skin-driven audio divination noise module, The Dark
Interpreter, and the ERD modular synthesizer series.
